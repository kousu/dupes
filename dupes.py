# tip: to compare this against fdupes, try:
#
# # set up some test data
# python -m virtualenv venv1
# python -m virtualenv venv2
# . venv1/bin/activate
# pip install requests dcm2bids
#  deactivate 
# . venv2/bin/activate
#  pip install dcm2bids future
# deactivate
#
# # symlinks too:
# mkdir links
# echo wtf > lol
# ln -s ../lol links/a
# ln -s ../lol links/b

# Then try:
# diff -ru <(fdupes -r . | sort | sed '/^$/d')  <(./dupes.py . | sort |  sed '/^$/d')


# This is a tree-hash based implementation. It's a relatively simple extension from what fdupes does:
# https://github.com/adrianlopezroche/fdupes/blob/master/fdupes.c
# Basically, it hashes everything, *including folders themselves*, and uses that to sort content into buckets.
# Then it filters out all the non-duplicates, *and child duplicates*, and prints.
#
# There are some problems with the tree-hash:
# 1. it implies you need checksums computed for all files, even ones you wouldn't otherwise need to checksum
#    - worked around with a clever hack, but it's definitely a hack
# 2. the diff(1) step ends up re-diffing subtrees
# 3. it doesn't handle non-files (i.e. sockets, fifos, block devices, symlinks)
#    - I hacked in symlink support, but the others are trickier
#    - fdupes doesn't handle symlinks either it turns out! it completely ignores them!
#
# I think it should be possible to replace the tree hash with a dynamic program.
# That is, cleverly work upwards from the leaves to construct equivalence classes of directories.
# That should make it easier to handle non-regular-files and it will definitely avoid needing to run `diff -r`.
